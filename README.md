# Vonnegut-Bot

I propose to consider the question: can machines write?

In a new and dizzying world of machine-crafted text, we are faced with an obvious possibility. What if we could distil a writer's style with such purity and such precision that the writer is eclipsed not only in speed, not only in skill, but in being themselves, even long after their death?

Vonnegut-Bot is an LLM that has achieved the unthinkable: an automated writer that is a better Kurt Vonnegut than Kurt Vonnegut.

In every metric measured, Vonnegut-Bot scored higher in the category of Vonnegut-ness than Vonnegut's own writing. This lightweight program can accurately replicate and extend Vonnegut's beloved idiosyncrasies to the point that, were he still alive, we would no longer need him. We have arrived in a brave new world.

For more detail about this program, look out for a video about Kurt Vonnegut's novel The Sirens of Titan arriving soon on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@OliverLugg
